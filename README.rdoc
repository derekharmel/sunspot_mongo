== Installation

=== Mongo Mapper

Put the following in your Gemfile:

  gem 'bson_ext'
  gem 'mongo_mapper'
  gem 'sunspot_mongo'

Then run:

  rails g mongo_mapper:config
  rails g sunspot_rails:install
  rake sunspot:solr:start

=== Mongoid

  gem 'moped'
  gem 'mongoid'
  gem 'sunspot_mongo'

Then run:

  rails g mongoid:config
  rails g sunspot_rails:install
  rake sunspot:solr:start

== Usage

Add the following to your model (assuming you have a string field named "content"):

  include Sunspot::Mongo
  searchable do
    text :content
  end

Then search like usual:

  search = Article.search do
    fulltext "something interesting"
  end
  search.results

Note: Mongoid adds Article.search, use Article.solr_search instead.
